# AdventureGame 🎮

## Project Overview
AdventureGame is a text-based, console-driven role-playing game (RPG) collaboratively developed in C#. The goal of this project was to strengthen our understanding and application of object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts, as well as practicing good software development practices through teamwork.

## Main Features 🌟
- **Tile-based Game World:** Navigate and interact through a dynamic, event-driven environment.
- **Interactive Gameplay Mechanics:**
  - Character creation and customization
  - Turn-based combat mechanics
  - Snake mini-game integration
  - Inventory management
  - Map navigation and tile interactions

## Technical Skills Demonstrated 🛠️
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):**
  - Encapsulation
  - Inheritance
  - Polymorphism
  - Abstraction
  - composition
- **Collaborative Development:**
  - Effective version control with Git and GitHub
  - Feature branches, merging, and version control

## How to Run 🚀
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Remmold/AdventureGame.git
   ```
2. **Open the project in Visual Studio.**  
3. **Build and run** the application from your IDE or terminal.  

## Future Enhancements 🚀  
Possible extensions and improvements for future versions:  

- Enhanced combat mechanics and enemy AI  
- Expanded storyline and additional interactive content  
- Save/load game functionality  
- User interface improvements beyond console interactions  

## Developed by  
This project was created in collaboration with my study colleague, Vegetablecloud (Ludvig Johansson), during our software development education, demonstrating effective teamwork, clear coding conventions, and joint problem-solving capabilities.
